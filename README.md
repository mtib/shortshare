# shortshare
Easy sharing of data using compression and encoding.

## binary
This repository provides a single binary alongside the library functions, `go get github.com/mtib/shortshare`, then pipe into `shortshare` to generate shareable text, and pipe shared text into `shortshare -u` to decompress and decode.

## library
It's pretty easy to figure out ;)
